1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware functions have access to the request object (req), the response 
object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. 
These functions are usedÂ to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, 
adding response headers, etc.


2. What does CRUD stand for?

Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These four basic operations are necessary to implement 
a persistent storage application.


3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

First, you need to install an npm package, such as "dotenv" that automatically loads environment 
variables from a .env file into the process. The dotenv package will be listed as a dependency 
in your package.json file. In the .env file, you create a variable that will contain the sensitive 
information. For example, a URI that contains the database password:

    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://J_Jimenez:<password>@nodeexpressprojects.uryquno.mongodb.net/03-TASK-MANAGER?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Finally, you need to require the .env file in your app.js file:

    require('dotenv').config();


    b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github
       repository?

You need to include the .env file in the .gitignore file so 
that it doesn't get pushed to github, where any hacker can "scrape" your personal information.
